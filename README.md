# RipGREP-cleanup
Incredibly quick RipGREP script to clear lines in a readable format. 

This script is intended for leaks using a ':' colon delimiter; rewrite the .bat script if you're trying to clean a file with a different delimiter, e.g. semicolons as:
/*  stuart.******3@ntlworld.com;ma****** */
